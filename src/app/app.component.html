        The aim is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4
        colored circles. Each guest results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the
        code. The winner solves the secret code with as little guesses as possible.

        NOTES
        (a) A black small circle to indicate a Code Circle of the right color and in the right position
        (without indication of which Code Circle it corresponds to).
        (b) A light orange small circle indicates a Code Circle of the right color but in the wrong position.
